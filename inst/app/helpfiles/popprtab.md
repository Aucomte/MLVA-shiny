*N* = number of individuals in the specified population; MLG=number of multilocus genotypes found in the population;
*eMLG* = the expected MLG at the lowest common sample size;
*SE* = standard error for the rarefaction analysis; H=Shannon-Weiner diversity index;
*G* = Stoddard and Taylor’s index;
*lambda* = Simpson’s index;
*E.5* = Evenness estimate;
*Hexp* = Nei’s gene diversity (expected heterozygosity);
*la* = index of association for each population factor (a measure of multilocus linage disequilibrium);
*p.la* = p-value for la;
*rbarD* = Standardised index of association;
*p.rD* = p-value for rbarD.

The *genotype accumulation curve* is generated by the Poppr package (R::poppr:: genotype_curve, https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.281). It describes the genotypic diversity in relation to different combinations of TR loci, and is used to estimate the genotypic resolution of the MLVA scheme (further details: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01522.x). 
The curve is generated by sampling x loci randomly and counting the number of multilocus genotypes (MLG) observed. This sampling is repeated r times from 1 to n-1 loci, creating n-1 distributions of observed MLGs. The genotypic resolution is considered good when the curve reaches a plateau.
